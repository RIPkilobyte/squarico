I declare that I am a Certified Sophisticated Investor for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Financial Promotion) Order 2005. I understand that this means:<br><br>
1. I have a written certificate signed within the last 36 months by a firm confirming I have been assessed by that firm as sufficiently knowledgeable to understand the risks associated with engaging in investment activity in non-mainstream pooled investments; and<br><br>
2. I have signed, within the period of twelve months ending with the day on which the communication is made, a statement in the following terms:<br><br>
I declare that I am a certified sophisticated investor for the purposes of the Financial Services and Markets Act (Financial Promotions) Order 2005.<br><br>
I understand that this means:<br><br>
(a) I can receive financial promotions that may not have been approved by a person authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority and which are exempt from the restriction on promotion of non-mainstream pooled investments or unregulated products investing in unlisted companies<br>
(b) The content of such financial promotions may not conform to rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority<br>
(c) I may lose significant rights by signing this statement<br>
(d) I may have no right to complain to either of the following:<br>
(i) The Financial Conduct Authority, or<br>
(ii) The Financial Ombudsman Scheme<br>
(e) I may have no right to seek compensation from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme<br><br>
I make this statement so that I can receive promotional communications which are exempt from the restriction on promotion of non-mainstream pooled investments. The exemption relates to certified sophisticated investors and I declare that I qualify as such.<br><br>
I accept that the investments to which the promotions will relate may expose me to a significant risk of losing all of the money or other property invested. I am aware that it is open to me to seek advice from an authorised person who specialises in advising on non-mainstream pooled investments.<br><br>
I accept that this may expose me to a significant risk and I could lose my property and other assets from making these investment decisions based on financial promotions.<br><br>
I am aware that it is open to me to seek advice from someone who specialises in advising on investments.
